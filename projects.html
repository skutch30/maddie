            <img src="assets/verizon-project-1.png" alt="Screenshot of Verizon Project 1">
            <p>During my internships at Verizon, I developed and automated an inventory management system leveraging
                OpenShift API and Redfish technology to collect and organize essential hardware details from multiple
                clusters of bare metal servers. I improved and facilitated inventory tracking and strategic
                decision-making for maintenance and upgrades. I designed a user-friendly interface for the easy access
                and visualization of hardware information.</p>
            <p><b>Tools used: Node.js, PostgreSQL, OpenShift API, Redfish</b></p>

            <h2>Dynamic Power Optimization and Emissions Monitoring in Kubernetes Clusters</h2>
            <img src="assets/verizon-project-2.png" alt="Screenshot of Verizon Project 2">
            <p>During my internships at Verizon, I integrated Red Hat's Kepler power-monitoring platform to monitor the
                carbon dioxide emissions and total power consumption of numerous pods and containers in the North
                Seattle cluster. I set up dashboards on Grafana to easily identify the top namespaces in power
                consumption, and deployed a cpu frequency container image within Kubernetes in order to dynamically
                reduce power consumption as needed in such namespaces.</p>

            <p>In my CS 2340 (Objects & Design) class, I collaborated with team of four other studetns to develop a 2D
                Dungeon Crawler Adventure Game using Java throughout five two-week Sprints following the Agile project
                management methodology. We implemented core gameplay features, including various levels, a leaderboard,
                and start, configuration, and end screens, while integrating object-oriented design principles.

            <p>In my CS 4460 (Information Visualization) class, I individually created an HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
                visualization displaying all the named moons orbiting the planets of our solar system,
                including dwarf planet Pluto.

            <img src="assets/cs2200-project.png" alt="Screenshot of CS 2200">
            <p>In my CS 2200 (Systems & Networks) class, I individually designed a series of datapaths for a RISC
                computer based on MIPS. Using CircuitSim, a logic simulator, I built on top of my initial datapath
                and implemented logic for interrupts and support for external I/O devices.</p>

            <img src="assets/vip-project.png" alt="Screenshot of VIP Project">
            <p>I worked alongside researchers with the Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI) to examine and assess the
                existence of cybersecurity found within IoT hardware devices. I conducted a multi-domain investigation
                through the use of hardware reverse engineering, software/firmware reverse engineering using Ghidra, and
                RF analysis along with static and dynamic testing through instrumentation. In my most recent semester, I
                developed and spoofed a surrogate device design for the Signaling Line Circuit network of a wireless
                fire alarm system using an Arduino microcontroller. I tested and demonstrated any identified holes in
                the devicesâ€™ cybersecurity protection.

            <p>In my CS 4400 (Intro to Database Systems) class, I analyzed, designed, and implemented a database
                application based on a fictional drone-based delivery service company using MySQL. I developed an
                Enhanced Entity-Relationship Diagram (EERD) and relational schema with a team of two others.

            <img src="assets/crypto.png" alt="Screenshot of Crypto Algorithms">
            <p> Blockchain technology and algorithms require excessive energy consumption which, for many years, have
                harmed the physical environment in inconceivable ways. In this paper I discuss ethical concerns
                surrounding the harmful effects cryptocurrency has left on the environment all around the globe. I also
                offer recommendations and solutions to alleviate some of the damages that have already been done, and
                prevent more in the future before it is too late.</p>

            <img src="assets/jude-tobias.png" alt="Screenshot of Jude Tobias">
            <p>I surprised my father by developing and designing a promotional website for his poetry using HTML and
                CSS. I constructed website animations using JavaScript to enhance the user experience. I conducted
                extensive testing and debugging to ensure the website was fully functional and error-free.
                I collaborated closely with my father to incorporate his feedback into the final design.</p>
