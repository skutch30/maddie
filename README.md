# Welcome to Maddie's Website!

I am a senior at Georgia Institute of Technology studying Computer Science with concentrations in Information Internetworks and Human-Computer Interaction.

I am super passionate about exploring innovative solutions in technology that promote sustainability, smart energy practices, and enhancing user experiences through effective human-computer interaction!

In my (very limited) free time, I enjoy reading, running, and cooking new things-- you can find me on Goodreads and Strava.

Thanks for visiting, take a look around!
